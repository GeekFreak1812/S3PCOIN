Blockchain & Consensus Mechanism Simulation
This repository contains Python scripts that simulate fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and various consensus mechanisms. It's designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how blocks are structured, how Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining operates, and how different consensus algorithms (PoW, Proof-of-Stake, Delegated Proof-of-Stake) select validators.

Project Overview
This project aims to simplify complex blockchain concepts through practical, runnable simulations. You'll explore:
The basic building blocks of a blockchain and how they are cryptographically linked.
The process of "mining" in Proof-of-Work, involving the adjustment of a nonce to find a valid hash.
The core decision-making logic behind Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanisms.

Block_Simulation.py - Basic Blockchain Block Structure and Chaining
This script demonstrates the foundational elements of a blockchain by defining an S3PCOINBlock class and illustrating how individual blocks are created and linked together to form an immutable chain.
Key Concepts:
Block Structure: index, timestamp, transactions, previous_block_hash, nonce.
Cryptographic Hashing: Uses SHA-256 to generate unique block fingerprints, ensuring data integrity.
Immutability & Chaining: Blocks are linked by including the hash of the preceding block, making the chain tamper-evident.
How to Run:
Execute the file directly. It will create and display the details of three linked blocks.
python Block_Simulation.py


nonce_mining_simulation.py - Proof-of-Work (PoW) with Nonce Mining
This script extends the basic block concept to simulate the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, specifically focusing on the "mining" process where a nonce is found to satisfy a difficulty target.
Key Concepts:
Proof-of-Work (PoW): Simulation of computational effort (repeated hashing) to find a valid block hash.
Difficulty Target: A difficulty_prefix (e.g., "0000") defines the required starting characters of a valid hash.
Nonce: The arbitrary number adjusted by miners to change the block's hash.
Computational Cost: Measures the attempts and time taken to find a valid nonce, demonstrating PoW's resource intensity.
How to Run:
Run the script to observe the mining process for multiple blocks with varying difficulties.
python nonce_mining_simulation.py


consensus_mechanism_simulation.py - PoW, PoS, and DPoS Consensus Simulation
This script simulates and compares the validator selection logic of three common blockchain consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS).
Key Concepts:
Consensus Mechanisms: How different blockchain networks agree on the next block and select its producer.
Selection Criteria: Demonstrates that each mechanism uses a different primary criterion:
PoW: Computational power (simulated).
PoS: Staked cryptocurrency (simulated).
DPoS: Community votes.
Mock Simulations: Simplified models to highlight the core decision-making processes.
How to Run:
Execute the file to see the simulation of validator selection for each consensus mechanism.
python consensus_mechanism_simulation.py
